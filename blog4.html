          <h3>Stay in Budget Hostels</h3>
          <p>Goa has plenty of affordable hostels and guesthouses, especially in backpacker-friendly areas like Anjuna, Vagator, Baga, and Palolem. 
            These hostels offer dormitory-style stays, private rooms, and common areas where travelers can connect and share experiences. 
            Many budget accommodations come with free Wi-Fi, basic breakfast, and helpful staff who can guide you to lesser-known spots. 
            If you book in advance, you can get amazing deals during peak season. Staying in such hostels not only saves money but also allows you to meet like-minded travelers.</p>

          <h3>Rent a Scooter</h3>
          <p>The best way to explore Goa is on two wheels. Scooters are available for rent at very affordable rates, usually ranging from ‚Çπ300 to ‚Çπ500 per day. 
            Having your own scooter means you can travel at your own pace, discover hidden beaches, and avoid the cost of taxis and cabs. 
            Riding along the coastal roads with the breeze and palm trees around you is a memorable experience in itself. 
            Just remember to carry your driving license and wear a helmet for safety and to avoid fines.</p>
